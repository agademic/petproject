In this diagram you can see some action nodes. Yo have a start node and an end node. 
On the right there is a branching. Object nodes are not drawn. In this way, you could insert objects in various places, which are
then available at that point. For example, a rabbit object that is killed by the police after a successful bullet shoot. Or
an object representing the entire game including rabbits and the police.
